- Run `npm i && npm run watch` to start a hot reloading server that also connects to your chrome console
- The server accepts an _optional_ command line argument that will set the total number of groups. This only works with `npm start`: `npm start -- --groups=50`. Note that you need to add `--` before the groups arg. [See this StackOverflow Post for more information](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11580961/sending-command-line-arguments-to-npm-script)
