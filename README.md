# Flatiron Field Day

## General

This repo houses a the applications for the Flatiron Field Day/Hackathon. The
goal is to have students interface programmatically with some personal,
interpersonal, and meatbag vs. machine competitive programming.

If you are programming for the project, or interested in what it emulates in
features, please check out what this is
based off of:
  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit))
  - [the original developers' team blog](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/)
  - [and if you are a glutton for information: the OG /r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place)

If you are programming, [this is an excellent read and will make your mind
dank for programming this
project.](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/).


## What the Students Get

While a lot of the project is very similar to /r/place, we are trying to make
this not only friendly to, but designed for, students learning how to program.
This will enable them with a day long project to get creative.

Some of the skills they will hone are:
  - Team programming
  - Rapid development
  - Automation
  - Matrix data structures
  - Minor network 'hacking'
  - Programming for asynchronous environments

#### This is BETA!

We did this once before in the summer of 2017 for students at the Manhattan
campus. It was an early and rushed iteration (pre-alpha at best), but a big
success in turn out and feedback.

We are looking to greatly improve this with a bigger team, better code, and more
hype. Ideally, this will be the beta version for something we extend to all
campuses + online in the future.


#### This sounds fun, but what's the VALUE!?

Regardless of how you would like to contribute, this gives you a chance to play
an integral team role in launching a live application. You can practice your
skills, be creative/have fun, and grow your portfolio in one fell swoop.
