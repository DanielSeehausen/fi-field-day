## General

This repo houses a the applications for the Flatiron Field Day/Hackathon. The

#### This is BETA!

We did this once before in the summer of 2017 for students at the Manhattan
campus. It was an early and rushed iteration (pre-alpha at best), but a big
success in turn out and feedback.

We are looking to greatly improve this with a bigger team, better code, and more
hype. Ideally, this will be the beta version for something we extend to all
campuses + online in the future.
