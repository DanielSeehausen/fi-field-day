# Flatiron Field Day

## General

This repo houses A hackathon-esque application for FI students. Students interface programmatically with some personal, interpersonal, and meatbag v machine competitive programming.

If you are programming for the project, or interested in what it emulates in features (if not implementation and interaction) please check out what this is based off of:
  - **i'm a sloth**: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit)
  - **i'm just lazy**: [the team's blog](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/)
  - **i'm a glutton for information**: [the OG /r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place)

If you are programming the **server**, the **user-node-client**, or the canvas on **browser-board-client**, [this is an excellent read and will make your mind dank for programming this project.](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/)
